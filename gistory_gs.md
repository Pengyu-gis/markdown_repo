## 01 Research Directions and Research Experience

Regardless of the field, establishing a research direction is the first step to entering academia.  
Dr. Gao notes that identifying a research focus involves many factors, with the breadth and depth of disciplinary understanding being especially crucial. This requires extensive reading of classic works and literature in the field to gain deep insight into the discipline.

For example, in Geographic Information Science (GIScience), the first priority is to understand the classic works in the field and the varying perspectives of leading scholars, thereby deepening one’s theoretical foundation. As an interdisciplinary field at the crossroads of geography and information science, GIScience is highly extensible, with widespread applications in public health, urban planning, climate change, and human behavior. In these applications, identifying the value of geographic information and pinpointing valuable research opportunities is key.  

In addition, personal interest is essential. Finding a research topic that excites and motivates you is indispensable. Dr. Gao believes that selecting a concrete research direction requires combining three aspects: an understanding of the discipline (such as urgent scientific problems), potential interdisciplinary applications, and one’s own interests and strengths.

Meeting the right mentors can also greatly help to broaden research horizons. Throughout his academic journey, Dr. Gao has had teachers who profoundly influenced him: Professors Huiping Liu and Shangyi Zhou at Beijing Normal University; Professors Yu Liu, Yong Gao, and Lun Wu at Peking University; and his Ph.D. advisor Krzysztof Janowicz, along with dissertation committee members Michael Goodchild and Helen Couclelis.

Dr. Gao’s primary research direction is using location-based spatiotemporal big data and GeoAI methods to analyze human mobility and place perception.  
One of his most memorable tenure-track experiences was applying for an NSF RAPID grant in 2020.  

At the start of 2020, the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 became a research hotspot. Given the time-sensitive nature of RAPID proposals, Dr. Gao received news of the opportunity on a Friday, quickly assembled a multidisciplinary team over the weekend, completed the proposal, and successfully submitted it on Monday—becoming one of the earliest teams to analyze human travel patterns and the spatiotemporal spread of the virus.

</p>

The project brought together expertise in GIScience, mathematical modeling, public health, and science communication, fully demonstrating GIScience’s interdisciplinary nature. It required not only mathematical modeling but also public engagement and community outreach to predict and monitor the virus’s spatiotemporal spread and to raise public awareness of infectious disease risks, enabling protective actions. Under Dr. Gao’s guidance, students and scholars on the project produced outstanding research results, with articles published in *PNAS* (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences) and *Scientific Data*.

Dr. Gao emphasizes that many research questions should not stop at pure modeling; they must also consider broader factors such as the social needs of multiple stakeholders. In applied research, one must not only think about methods but also answer why the research matters—who will benefit and in what ways.  

From 2020 to 2021, Dr. Gao actively participated in public policy discussions in Wisconsin, sharing professional advice and unique insights with local communities. Building on his team’s COVID-19 research, he emphasized the close link between research outcomes and public welfare. His Ph.D. student Yunlei Liang joined a Wisconsin Department of Health Services project using GIS and mobile location data for public health zoning, ensuring that medical resources reached more people. These projects were directly connected to public needs and provided valuable references for policy-making.

</p>
Throughout the process, he did not see tenure as a source of pressure but as the natural result of fulfilling his duties as a university professor. He maintained a positive, optimistic attitude: *“Strategically, take it lightly; tactically, take it seriously.”* He focused on doing three things well: **research, teaching, and service**.

**Research:**  
For Dr. Gao, the primary goal is for himself and his team to make significant contributions within subfields of the discipline. Clear research planning is crucial. His team focuses on geospatial data science and GeoAI, developing new spatial analysis methods grounded in GIScience theory and exploring innovative applications.  

For example, in studying human mobility, they integrate mobile phone and social media data to investigate human behavioral influences and social relationship modeling. They also develop new methods that combine AI, deep learning, and spatial thinking to achieve more effective results.  

This has led to new research directions, such as innovative work on location privacy protection using GeoAI—especially relevant given heightened public awareness during the pandemic. His Ph.D. student Jinmeng Rao has focused on this topic. Another Ph.D. student, Yuhao Kang, addresses bias and transferability challenges in GeoAI models caused by data quality and spatial heterogeneity, studying cognitive and model biases in human perception of urban environments and places. Both have achieved substantial results, publishing multiple papers and acquiring essential technical skills in GeoAI.

**Teaching:**  
Dr. Gao values teaching highly. While teaching differs from research, the two can complement each other. For example, foundational issues such as data representativeness and uncertainty in geospatial big data are not only research concerns but also valuable teaching content, reinforced through coursework and lab exercises.  

He integrates cutting-edge research into his classes, which cover both undergraduate introductory courses and advanced graduate courses in geospatial data science. His curriculum emphasizes spatial thinking, GIS principles, programming in Python and R, and spatiotemporal data analysis. Through these courses, students gain practical research methods, tools, and programming skills that support independent research, capstone projects, and academic work.  

Dr. Gao also sees excellent teaching as a way to attract outstanding undergraduates from diverse fields—geography, environmental science, data science, computer science, engineering, political science, economics, and business—bringing fresh perspectives and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration within the lab.

**Service:**  
Dr. Gao has long held key roles in academic organizations, actively serving the GIScience community—for example, as President of the CPGIS Council, Co-Chair of the CPGIS Media Committee, Chair of the AAG GIScience & Systems Specialty Group, and Chair of the UCGIS Communications Committee. He also serves as Associate Editor of *IJGIS* and has been Associate Editor of *Annals of GIS*.  

His dedication to service began during his student years, when he served as President of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association at UCSB and as President of the Western U.S. Chinese Students and Scholars Association, representing 33 universities. These experiences shaped his strong sense of community service in academia. He enjoys contributing to academic organizations, mentoring younger scholars, and helping organize events—such as CPGIS’s 30th anniversary celebrations during his term as President.

Dr. Gao believes that research, teaching, and service are inseparable; excelling in all three naturally leads to tenure success.

## 03 Student Mentorship and Lab Management

The GeoDS Lab under Dr. Gao has earned high praise for its atmosphere. He likens running a lab to leading a startup, focusing on three key tasks: **building the team, setting the strategy, and leading the group**.

**Building the team:**  
Selecting students is a two-way process—the advisor chooses students, and students choose the advisor. Each year, the lab receives many strong applications. Through multiple interview rounds, Dr. Gao selects candidates who fit the lab’s culture and can enrich its diversity. Current members include five Ph.D. students, numerous master’s students, and undergraduates undertaking capstone projects through short-term internships.

</p>

**Setting the strategy:**  
Dr. Gao tailors training plans to each student’s personality, background, and interests. He is open to students pursuing either academic or industry careers, encouraging summer internships as opportunities for exploration without academic pressure. These experiences often lead to fresh ideas and partnerships—such as the lab’s strategic collaboration with Arity, which originated from a student internship.

</p>

Social activities—hiking, skiing, and gatherings—help strengthen team bonds. Academic culture is also emphasized, with regular discussions of research interests.

**Leading the group:**  
When the lab was small, direct management worked; once it grew beyond five members, Dr. Gao delegated leadership responsibilities to Ph.D. students, allowing them to mentor undergraduates and gain advising experience. Weekly group meetings maintain communication, while important issues are discussed by the entire lab. This “mentorship chain” has been key to the lab’s success.

## 05 Future Challenges for GeoAI

In his review article in the *Journal of Wuhan University (Information Science Edition)*, Dr. Gao summarized recent developments and challenges in GeoAI. He has also co-edited the forthcoming *Handbook of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence* with Dr. Yingjie Hu (University at Buffalo) and Dr. Wenwen Li (Arizona State University), collaborating with over 90 scholars worldwide to present systematic discussions, cutting-edge methods, applications, and future outlooks.

One major challenge is geospatial data labeling for supervised learning.  
Two key issues are:  
1. **Security:** Geospatial data is sensitive and tied to national mapping security—labeling must ensure information safety.  
2. **Openness:** Building a large, collaborative geospatial data community to promote data-sharing culture is vital.
