## 01 First Encounter: Tradition and Continuity

The National Undergraduate GIS Application Skills Competition, co-hosted by the China Association for Geographic Information Society and the Geographical Society of China, is one of the largest GIS competitions in the country. It is usually held every November.

The four interviewees first learned of it in their second semester through the “Introduction to GIS” course. ECNU’s School of Geographic Sciences has a long tradition of participating, winning multiple Special and First Prizes in previous years. However, when they entered in 2019, the senior team competing in the 8th competition suffered a major setback, returning empty-handed from Anhui Normal University.

This defeat left a deep impression on Bo Tang.  
> “When we got to the section on coordinate systems and projections, the professor repeatedly stressed their importance — because the Class of 2017 forgot to set projections and calculated distances directly from latitude/longitude, costing them an award.”

The competition’s rules require all teams to have no more than four undergraduate members, and each school may send only one team. ECNU holds a campus selection process each September. Jiachen Chen had aimed to participate since his sophomore year. In 2020, he joined dozens of juniors for the school’s 9th competition selection round. Despite not having learned all the content, his solid knowledge carried him through the 50-to-8 preliminary, but he was eliminated in the final 8-to-4 round.

Chen noted the difficulty: “Freshmen basically know nothing; sophomores know a little but not enough — so the winners are usually juniors.”  
Bingqi Xie added that the standard GIS courses, *Introduction to GIS* and *Advanced GIS Tutorial*, only covered basics like projections and clipping, but not the advanced analytical tasks the competition demands.

## 02 Training: Learning Teamwork in Weekly Practice

Once selected for ECNU’s 10th competition team, Thursday night practices became routine. Each week, they tackled a past competition question under timed conditions (2.5 hours), then reviewed solutions with a senior who had won a Special Prize the previous year. One of the first challenges was deciding **team roles**.

  <em>The team during training</em>
</p>
Unlike math modeling competitions, the GIS Application Skills Competition is more complex. Each 150-minute session (morning and afternoon) involves one large problem with 4–5 tasks. Teams must submit all datasets and a detailed work report including problem analysis, process description with screenshots, and results.

> “School selection tests individual ability, but the final result depends on the whole team,” said Xie.  
> “Training was not only about GIS skills, but also about teamwork.”

Their roles were: Chen — analysis; Tang — map production; Kong — report writing; Xie — assisting everyone.  
Kong explained:  
> “Once we agreed on the approach, I wrote the report — problem analysis, data intro, workflow diagram, then step-by-step operations. I wrote non-stop to meet the deadline.”

Time pressure demanded efficiency. Tang shared:  
> “I learned many cartography tricks; Kong set up report templates; others reviewed GIS tools from textbooks by Tang Guo’an and Naixia Mou.”  
Tang also posted tutorial videos on Bilibili during prep, gaining 40,000+ views and active discussions.

## 03 Competition Day: Mind the Details, Adapt on the Fly

Kong recalled a memorable moment from the morning session:  
> “One task was vectorizing China’s national boundaries. Our cartography course had emphasized marking disputed borders and the nine-dash line, so we highlighted them in our report — something the judges later praised.”

Chen emphasized the need for traceability:  
> “Every step must have a rationale; results and filenames must be consistent so team members can exchange data seamlessly.”

The afternoon brought surprises.  
Tang recounted:  
> “We got the data before the password, so we guessed its contents — wrongly. The task involved solar energy, a toolset none of us had opened. Still, in the last minutes we calculated decent results and submitted.”

Xie’s quick learning was crucial:  
> “I read the Help panel for unfamiliar tools, guessed functions from their names, and tested parameters.”  
Preparation is vital — but fast adaptation can save the day.

## 04 Reflection: Continuous Learning and Communication

GIS competition veteran Professor Naixia Mou has said the real challenge is persistence. Tang agreed:  
> “Keep learning — not just ArcGIS tools, but how to transfer knowledge to solve new problems.”

Xie valued repeated review:  
> “We reworked a tough network analysis problem multiple times, finding new details each run.”

For Kong, the biggest growth was applying theory to practice:  
> “Classes teach steps; competitions teach applying tools to real problems.”

Teamwork was the most cherished gain. Chen said:  
> “Books improve individual skills; only shared goals teach collaboration.”  
Tang recalled the proctor’s praise:  
> “We communicated actively, cared about each other’s progress, and no one worked in isolation.”

## 05 Advice

- **Chen Jiachen**: “Start early — and don’t forget projections. Learn GIS basics in Year 1, review past papers in Year 2, and talk to instructors.”
- **Tang Bo**: “Try what you like; success or failure, new experiences are valuable. GIS is a universal language for many disciplines — not just geography.”
- **Kong Weiya**: “Focus on solid coursework and a systematic understanding of ArcMap tools. Read ahead if needed, and always link theory to real-world problems.”
- **Xie Bingqi**: “Undergraduates should build strong foundations, join research groups for practical projects, and follow their own pace while staying curious.”
