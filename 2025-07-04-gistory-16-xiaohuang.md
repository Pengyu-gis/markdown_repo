## 01. Collaboration Over Isolation

On the path of research, even the strongest individual cannot outperform an efficient and cohesive team. As interdisciplinarity and global collaboration become the norm, cross-field cooperation is emerging as a key driver of scientific progress.

Dr. Huang exemplifies this spirit of “team science.” Utilizing GIS and GeoAI, he breaks disciplinary boundaries to work side-by-side with scholars from various domains, co-constructing a richer academic picture.

Geography is no longer confined to “drawing maps”—it has become a super tool supporting health, environment, and social sciences. For example, in studying how “sleep deprivation may lead to obesity,” geographers can use big data to perform spatiotemporal modeling. However, to answer the “why,” public health theories and experiments are indispensable to uncover causality.

No one can master every discipline. Even seasoned researchers cannot single-handedly complete complex, interdisciplinary work. Collaboration, then, becomes a kind of “power-up”—compensating for disciplinary gaps and enriching research with both technical and theoretical support.

Finding the right partner can expand not only the scope but also the impact of research. Importantly, collaboration should not be about taking—it’s about mutual growth. Dr. Huang shares that many people choose to collaborate with him because of his strong technical foundation. In return, he continually refines his skills to become a “hexagonal warrior.”

Whether contributing baseline models, supporting data analysis, or designing high-quality visualizations, he strives to enhance research clarity and persuasiveness. When pushing for top-tier publications, he also takes the initiative to refine article structure and logic to elevate the quality of the work.

> “When you truly add value to your collaborators,” he says, “partnerships become a win–win cycle.” As your network grows, so do your resources—and new opportunities will follow.

## 02. Seeking Truth in the Field

To ensure research has real-world impact, one must leave the lab and enter the field. To advance a malaria prevention project funded by the Gates Foundation, Dr. Huang led his team to Ethiopia for a rigorous field investigation.

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center"><em>Figure 4. Dr. Huang collecting mosquito data in Ethiopia</em></p>


There, research didn’t mean coding behind a screen—it meant starting at 5:30 a.m., trekking kilometers under 40°C heat across highlands, swamps, and valleys, collecting data on adult and larval Anopheles mosquitoes. The journey was both physically and mentally demanding.

They stayed in basic lodgings—wooden plank beds with only mosquito nets for protection. At night, they endured wild dog barks and constant buzzing. They saw children walking 3 kilometers to school daily and witnessed local demand for public health resources.

In Afar, obtaining drone flight permissions required negotiations with military officials—far beyond just paperwork. It was a process of repeated dialogue and building mutual trust.

The fieldwork was more than a research task; it was a deeply interdisciplinary and cross-cultural engagement, a response to global responsibility. One highlight was a formal meeting with **Dr. Hiwot Solomon**, Chief Executive Officer of Ethiopia’s Ministry of Health’s Disease Prevention and Control.

They exchanged views on malaria transmission, mosquito monitoring, data sharing, and public health intervention. Using visualizations and high-resolution remote sensing images, Dr. Huang demonstrated how spatial analysis could identify mosquito hotspots—offering a spatial perspective for decision-making.

## 03. Research Must Be Seen

Research should not remain behind closed doors. To make an impact, it must be shared and seen. Dr. Huang actively updates his academic progress on **LinkedIn**, where he had over **6,300 followers** as of May 2025.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98174a70-4134-4b00-a544-90404e13f851" width="415" height="262" alt="Dr. Huang's LinkedIn screenshot"/>
</p>

For him, academic outreach is more than broadcasting results—it’s about creating connections. By sharing progress, one can gather feedback, spark new ideas, and attract unexpected collaborations.

> “Every journey starts from zero,” Dr. Huang says.  
> Even if few notice you at first, consistent and well-paced sharing will eventually build momentum.

There are many ways to increase research visibility. Science-focused public accounts are helping peers stay up to date. Collaborating with such platforms can expand your audience and refine your work through feedback.

Similarly, international platforms like LinkedIn are increasingly used by research teams to announce achievements. Scholars, institutions, and practitioners across disciplines may become readers—or even future collaborators.

> “I often scroll LinkedIn, reading others’ titles or abstracts,” he says.  
> “Sometimes I click in because something piques my interest.”

Academic communication is bidirectional: we share our work, but we also learn from others. Methods, data, or ideas we see can inspire new research paths.

Ultimately, the goal of scholarly outreach is simple:  
**Let valuable and interesting research be seen.**  
Don’t let your work sit in a drawer. Express it. Share it. Promote it.  
Visibility isn’t about popularity—it’s about enabling deeper exchange and collaboration.

## 04. Job Hunting Is Not Just Luck

In academia, no one secures a position with a single application. Given the fierce competition and inherent uncertainty, proactive and persistent effort is key to success.

Dr. Huang summarizes his job-hunting strategy in three characters:  
**“Apply! Apply! Apply!”**

Today's academic job market is more competitive than ever. On one hand, applicants come from diverse backgrounds: fellow Ph.D. graduates, current faculty members, even one’s own mentors or collaborators. On the other hand, truly open positions are limited—some are already informally reserved for senior candidates.

Thus, endurance and a high volume of applications are essential. When choosing schools, Dr. Huang suggests a **tiered strategy**: don’t only target top-tier institutions—include mid-level and regional universities too.

The academic job landscape is dynamic. Sometimes top institutions are highly competitive; at other times, unexpected opportunities arise elsewhere. If you only apply to a few “dream schools,” you may miss hidden openings.

A reasonable goal might be applying to 20–30 institutions. Eventually, one offer will be yours.

However, **quantity doesn’t mean carelessness**. Preparation is key. Dr. Huang emphasizes the importance of reading job descriptions thoroughly and tailoring materials accordingly. Pay close attention to keywords in the JD, and align your research and teaching experience with the position’s needs.

When writing your materials, refer to the department’s course offerings or curriculum to show what unique value you bring. Avoid generic phrases like “I’m excellent—please hire me.” Make it specific, targeted, and relevant.

Job hunting is both selection and presentation. A thoughtfully crafted cover letter is often more persuasive than 100 templated ones. In this competitive arena, preparation determines who seizes key opportunities.

## 05. Students Are Partners

Dr. Huang often says:  
> “Curvature doesn’t matter. What matters is slope.”  
> —In other words, where you start doesn’t matter. What counts is how fast you grow.

When selecting students, he doesn’t focus on past grades, but rather on their potential, research interest, and attitude toward academic work.

During the admission process, he doesn’t fixate on “hard metrics” like publication count or pedigree. Instead, he values well-rounded candidates with curiosity and drive. After several rounds of review, he typically interviews 10–20 candidates in depth to understand their goals, personality, and motivations. He also contacts references for a comprehensive evaluation.

That said, CVs and personal statements still play a role. Dr. Huang recalls being impressed by applicants who had no papers but showed strong project experience, skill development, and a willingness to explore. He is always open to students with potential and passion.

One unique story stands out. A master's applicant had been consistently engaging with Dr. Huang on LinkedIn—liking posts, commenting, and sharing ideas via email. Over time, Dr. Huang was impressed by his enthusiasm and invited him to visit in person. That candidate received an offer.

Sometimes, genuine opportunities lie in persistent, sincere communication.

In student advising, Dr. Huang emphasizes: a good mentor doesn’t design a student’s future but respects their choices and supports their journey. Whether in academia or industry, **the best path is the one that fits.**

## 06. A Complete Guide to the Ph.D. Journey

Many early-career Ph.D. students struggle with common questions:  
*How do I choose a research direction?*  
*How do I build systematic thinking?*  
*How do I develop a professional network?*

Dr. Huang offers several practical suggestions:

**Step 1: Know what kind of scholar you want to become.**  
Everyone has different backgrounds and interests—there’s no universal template. If you’re good at coding, dive into algorithms and models. If you care about real-world issues, go into applied research. If you like critical thinking, the social sciences might be your path.

The key is to **understand yourself clearly** and avoid blindly following trends.

**Step 2: Develop systematic thinking.**  
Many Ph.D. students worry they lack a “big picture” perspective. Dr. Huang admits he also focused more on details early in his Ph.D., but over time, this broad perspective forms naturally through constant questioning and iteration.

As you work through small problems, trace back causes, connect ideas, and refine logic. Eventually, a structured way of thinking will emerge—especially when you become an independent researcher.

> “There’s no need to worry too much,” he says.  
> “Stay curious and reflective—systematic thinking will follow.”

**Step 3: Academic conferences are networking goldmines.**  
Doing great research is crucial, but so is connecting with others in your field. Dr. Huang built many lasting collaborations through conferences. Don’t treat them as just presentation venues—use them as social platforms to broaden your academic circle.

## 07. Final Thoughts

Academia is like a complex quest: it’s hard to solo, and much better as a team. To thrive, master core skills and become a “hexagonal warrior.” Then find trustworthy collaborators to build deeper, more impactful research.

Research isn’t finished once the paper is written. **Collaboration and communication** are what amplify your work and take it further.

In job hunting, instead of dwelling on the competitiveness, **improve your strategy**. Apply widely, stay proactive, and keep yourself in top form. Success has no fixed formula—**broad applications + precise targeting = better odds.**

The research path is tough—but if you stay connected and keep growing,  
you’ll carry the team all the way. GGWP!
