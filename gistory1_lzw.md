## Guest Introduction


**Zhewei Liu**, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).  
He earned his B.S. in Remote Sensing Science and Technology from Wuhan University in 2015 and his Ph.D. in Geographic Information Science from PolyU in 2021. He has served as a Research Assistant at PolyU, with research interests mainly in urban big data analytics and GeoAI.

## 01 From Luojia Hill to Victoria Harbour: Three Serendipitous Encounters

From Wuhan University at the foot of Luojia Hill to The Hong Kong Polytechnic University by Victoria Harbour, Liu’s decade-long academic journey from 2011 to 2022 can be summarized as three coincidences. Yet, it was precisely these three serendipitous encounters that shaped him into a GIS scholar.

The **first coincidence** was his connection with Wuhan University — and, due to a “misunderstanding,” his entry into the Remote Sensing Science and Technology program.  
“When I first came to Wuhan University to study remote sensing, I actually had little understanding of the discipline,” Liu admitted. Initially, he thought it was mainly about robotics. Later, after some research, he assumed it was about making satellites. Only after he started studying the subject in earnest did he realize what it actually entailed. In his words, his choice at the time was “somewhat blind.” Yet, as his understanding deepened, his interest grew.

The **second coincidence** was participating in the **Excellence Engineer Program** during his undergraduate years. This program, jointly run by Wuhan University and industry partners, offered him an internship at the Wuhan Surveying and Design Institute. Whereas coursework often emphasized fundamentals over specialization and theory over practice, this industry experience balanced the gap.

The **third coincidence** was his decision to study abroad. For many, studying overseas is full of uncertainty. In his first year, Liu never considered it an option and might have stayed at Wuhan University or another Chinese university. However, one day he came across a booklet published by the university’s International Exchange Office sharing study-abroad experiences. A story by a senior pursuing a Ph.D. at Yale deeply inspired him. He realized that after years of domestic education, experiencing a different learning and research environment could offer fresh perspectives and growth. Shortly afterward, a professor from PolyU visited Wuhan University, and after an in-depth discussion, Liu decided to pursue his Ph.D. there.

## 02 Effort Never Goes to Waste: Achievements Born from Deep Focus and Patience

Liu’s main research focus is **GIS + Human Mobility** — using geo-tagged big data to explore patterns in human activities. When he began his Ph.D., research on geospatial big data and human activity was thriving. With his advisor’s guidance, he plunged into this emerging field. Over the years, despite shifting trends, he stayed committed, publishing multiple papers in top journals.

Among his works, Liu is most proud of a paper not in a GIS top journal but in *Applied Geography* (2021): *Detecting home countries of social media users with machine-learned ranking approach: A case study in Hong Kong*. The study tackled **residence detection** — inferring someone’s home country from their activity trajectories. Existing methods often lacked precision. Liu innovatively reframed it as a **ranking problem**, using machine learning to rank countries visited by users. This novel approach improved accuracy and offered a fresh perspective on the task.

The work was not without challenges. Chief among them was the dataset. Training a machine learning model required large volumes of data, and preparing these — especially cleaning and labeling — took months. During a critical stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, Liu secluded himself at home and spent over two months labeling data, laying the groundwork for success.  
Looking back, he said: “Fortunately, during that time I could work remotely without distractions, allowing me to focus completely on solving research problems.” Such dedication likely explains his string of top-journal publications within just five years.

Liu’s research also stands out for its **wide collaborative network**. Beyond his core GIS focus, he has co-authored interdisciplinary works in other top-tier journals. For him, GIS is inherently a tool-based and interdisciplinary field whose advantages shine in cross-disciplinary collaboration. He encourages GIS researchers to engage with other disciplines — exchanging ideas, finding intersections, and applying GIS as a tool to innovate in new domains.

## 03 The Ph.D. Journey as a Spiritual Practice

Reflecting on his Ph.D. journey, Liu spoke candidly about pressure and mindset adjustment. Few have a completely smooth Ph.D. experience, and he was no exception. Early on, he faced significant pressure and prolonged confusion, especially about **how to do research**.  

<p align="center">

Like many direct-entry Ph.D. students, the transition from undergraduate to doctoral study was not easy. At first, research ideas often felt exciting but lacked academic rigor or feasibility. For his first two years, this uncertainty led to no tangible outputs.

<p align="center">
  <img width="835" alt="image" src="https://pub-b7009020d42e47bf93fb9f6c95502a87.r2.dev/gisphere_%E8%AE%BF%E8%B0%88/liuzhewei/6.jpg" />
</p>

Things changed in his third year. Through sustained literature reading and reflection, he gradually grasped what constituted a sound research idea and what made good research. This was not a sudden revelation but a gradual transformation that eventually culminated in an “aha” moment — the publication of his first paper. From then on, his research progressed far more smoothly.

## 04 Choosing the Right Track

Liu has strong opinions on career planning. From an uninformed high school student to a Ph.D. holder in GIS, he has distilled several insights on choosing one’s professional track:

1. **Choose an industry with a high ceiling.** Life is a process of compounding growth. Some industries may look glamorous at first but have low ceilings or systemic risks. Others may start modestly but offer strong long-term growth potential. The latter, with time and compounding, is more likely to yield ideal outcomes.

2. **Choose a track with a good input-output ratio.** As Charlie Munger said, “Go where the fish are.” Every field requires hard work to succeed, but the payoff varies. Highly competitive industries may demand extraordinary effort for limited returns, while others distribute resources more evenly — allowing solid results without being at the very top.

</p>

3. **Match your track to your personality and interests.** Passion and recognition of a field’s value are essential for sustained contribution. As economics teaches, behavior is about maximizing utility under constraints — so align interests with available resources to find the most suitable path.

## 05 Message to Students

In closing, Liu shared his advice for students at different academic stages.  
Undergraduates, he believes, are a group full of potential — young, energetic, and with low costs for trial and error. He encourages them to explore and experiment while young to find the life they truly love.

For graduate students, especially those pursuing a Ph.D., his greatest lesson is to find an advisor who is a good fit. While school rankings matter, sacrificing compatibility with your advisor can cause significant issues during graduate study. Doctoral training is a long-term refinement process — “One should take the long view.”
