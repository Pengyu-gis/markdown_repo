## 01 Learning for Application: An Enduring Bond with Engineering GIS

In recent years, GIS has been applied with astonishing breadth across academia and industry. However, few students today know that more than a decade ago, GIS education in China focused almost entirely on engineering software development. In the early 2000s, China’s rapid infrastructure development generated a high demand for GIS-related engineering projects. Under this backdrop, GIS graduates were often assigned to various agencies to work on engineering software development. At that time, Professor Mou was one of them — joining a listed company in Yantai to engage in GIS R&D, marking the start of his enduring bond with engineering GIS.

When he first began working in GIS development, Mou struggled with limited practical experience. Over time, through more projects, his programming skills improved. One of his most formative experiences was developing a **Power GIS System** for the company. In discussions with users, he discovered that high-voltage power distribution networks were complex, hazardous, and challenging to manage. A GIS system, however, could mitigate risks via remote monitoring and simplify repetitive tasks through spatial analysis, boosting productivity. The successful development of this system greatly facilitated enterprise management and reinforced his determination to focus on engineering GIS applications — a conviction that deeply influenced his later teaching career.

After years in industry, as his programming skills improved, Mou realized he needed a stronger theoretical foundation. He resolutely enrolled in a Ph.D. program in GIS at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). During his doctoral training, working alongside his advisor and peers, he gained new perspectives on programming:  
- **Don’t be superficial** — ask experienced colleagues for guidance to avoid detours.  
- **Develop independent debugging skills**, even memorizing code if needed until it becomes second nature.  

This period reinforced his belief that programming ability would only grow in importance in research and professional life as information technology advanced.

## 02 A Teacher’s Conscience: Never Misguide Students

Grateful for his doctoral mentor’s guidance, Mou decided against returning to the high-paying “coder” role in industry. Instead, he returned to his hometown in Shandong to become a university GIS lecturer, eager to share his years of experience with students.

In an essay, he wrote:  
> “There are two kinds of relationships I consider pure and noble, free from lowly interests. The first is blood relations; no one can compare to that. The second is the teacher-student relationship. From my first day at the podium, I have always reminded myself: One, never to flatter the powerful — this is the integrity of an intellectual; and two, never to misguide students — this is the conscience of a teacher.”

Over nearly twenty years at SDUST, Mou has witnessed the growth of GIS as a discipline while observing students’ varied educational and career paths. He expressed concern that many students lack clear career goals or systematic planning — often following trends without personal reflection, whether it be pursuing graduate studies, job hunting, or studying abroad.

He gave an example: in one class of 33 students, only three did not pursue graduate school, turning the undergraduate program into a “preparatory class” for entrance exams — often as a refuge from facing employment.

Prof. Mou warned that many follow the crowd into graduate programs without genuine interest in research, which can lead to poor adaptation and even psychological problems later. He advises students to consider personal circumstances and career fit alongside academic effort.

Every year, Mou welcomes new graduate students from across China. He tailors his guidance to individual strengths, organizing career-planning sessions at the start of the program. For those unsure of their interests, he might assign three months of code review or extensive literature reading followed by a group presentation, allowing students to discover and develop their research inclinations through practice.

He shared a story of one student who initially wanted to focus on programming. After struggling with coding, she pivoted to reading GIS application research papers, eventually producing quality research and publishing an SCI paper. Mou believes interests are discovered through exploration and can change over time — educators should respect and support such possibilities.

## 03 GIS Competitions: A Happy Accident with Lasting Impact

As a well-known figure in GIS education, Mou is closely associated with GIS competitions. For years, he has devoted significant effort to guiding SDUST teams to repeated success in national competitions, earning the school a stellar reputation in GIS.

This journey began unexpectedly. In earlier years, GIS graduates often struggled to find jobs due to thin résumés. One day, Mou discovered the **Esri Cup National GIS Software Development Competition for Chinese College Students**. He realized competitions could enrich students’ résumés, enhance their technical skills, and improve job prospects — and so began his role as a competition coach.

His first team, composed of 2005 GIS majors, developed a 3D geological borehole visualization platform. Despite first-time nerves, they won second prize in the finals, defeating higher-ranked institutions. Many participants landed excellent jobs thanks to this experience, solidifying Mou’s commitment to competition coaching.

Nearly two decades later, with stronger GIS industry demand, employment is no longer the main driver. Mou sees competitions as an equalizing platform where students from less prestigious schools can prove themselves alongside elite peers. His mantra to students:  
> “We can be knocked down, but never intimidated.”

In 2021, at the Esri Cup opening ceremony, Professor Huiping Liu from Beijing Normal University noted that SDUST had won more awards than any other school nationwide and highlighted Mou’s exceptional contributions.

For Mou, two qualities are key to competition success: **persistence** and **collaboration**. Persistent students — even without exceptional talent — often achieve the best results. Strong teams must be composed of complementary roles: an organizer/leader, a skilled programmer, and a confident presenter. Members must be willing to sacrifice for the collective good.

He advises GIS students new to competitions to start with traditional contests like Esri, SuperMap, or MapGIS Cups, focusing on remote sensing, geodesign, or software development. Lower-year undergraduates should build practical software skills early, analyze past winning projects, and form teams in advance.

## 04 Message to Students

In the GIS community, Mou is a legendary figure — not for groundbreaking research, but for his contributions as an **educator**. Many of the interviewers for this article were his juniors who had benefited from his textbooks.

For undergraduates just entering GIS, Mou hopes they build a solid academic foundation while enjoying a rich campus life. His expectations can be summed up in four phrases:  
**Broad scope, solid foundation, strong practical skills, and emphasis on theory**.

For master’s students — the backbone of China’s research workforce — he expects them to become capable of independently completing substantial tasks, learning research skills through their advisors’ projects, and independently writing papers.

For doctoral students, his bar is higher: they should know their research field better than their advisor and be able to “feed back” knowledge to their mentor.

For young faculty members, he urges balancing quality research with a commitment to teaching. As he says:  
> “People don’t know me for my papers or research, but for my teaching and textbooks.”

Mou’s unwavering dedication to teaching for over twenty years has nurtured generations of students — a lasting legacy.

> “As educators, we must interact with students, understand what they truly want and need — not just for them, but for ourselves. Young people always bring fresh ideas, and their perspectives can inspire us. In my view, it is teaching that keeps me forever young.”
